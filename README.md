## Deliverable - Update 1:
**Have you made any new ideas?**
Our team, Tesseract, has come up with an idea to help provide better health services to the society.thus, improve our standards of living. We understand that each of us must contribute to achieve our goal. Our app aims to make this process safe, easy and accessible. It creates a network of blood donors and hospitals striving to save a fellow humanâ€™s life. the app helps identify and treat patients with speed and accuracy.
**As a team, write a brief paragraph about what problem your team is trying to solve?**
4.3 lakh road accidents are recorded in India every year leading to 1.73 lakh casualties and 4.4 lakh injured. Most of these casualties could be prevented if help comes in time and in an effective manner. The first source of help in most of these cases are passersby whose help can save life and injury. Healtech aims to enable good samaritans by providing relevant information and equipping nearby hospitals to handle such scenarios more efficiently.

In case of an encounter with an accident, Healtech supports its users by providing navigation to nearest hospitals avoiding red zones to ensure timely treatment.  In India, as medical insurance is not a ubiquitous possession, hospitals are forced to wait till a relative has paid and agreed to the treatment before acting on necessary surgeries and medical procedures. Healtech also enables hospitals to identify and access the emergency contact of trauma patients simply by means of a fingerprint scan. This feature allows hospitals to disburse the necessary treatments even in cases where the patient is not able to give medical consent.

Every day 12,000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood. In India we encounter a demand of 15 million units of blood but collect only 11 million units of blood. This implies that we fall short by four million units. We believe this is due to the lack of awareness regarding the gravity of this situation. Our app intends to build a network of hospitals and willing donors that addresses this problem without causing inconvenience to the donor. The donor shall be approached only when he or she is a match. The application chooses the donors who are closest to the required place from the pool of suitable donors. The application creates a transparent network of hospitals in need and donors which would also battle the black market of blood.
